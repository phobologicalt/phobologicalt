Yo im phobo and im a learning java dev, currently working on 2 public projects  https://github.com/phobologicalt/autodupe-for-8b8t and https://github.com/phobologicalt/welcomer
I am also working on a private client called cathack.cc which is a crappy skid for me to learn java, when im done with it I will most likely pass it on to the masses. 
Thanks for reading ig, im phobo.
